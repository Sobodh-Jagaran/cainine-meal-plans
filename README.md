# Canine Meal Plan Guide Project Description

This project features an interactive "Canine Meal Plan Guide" designed to assist users in managing the daily diets of five specific dogs: two male Rottweilers (50-55kg), two female Rottweilers (40-45kg), and one female Pitbull (25-28kg). The application aims to provide detailed meal plans that collectively target approximately 4500 grams of food per day.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to offer clear, structured, and visually supported dietary options for the specified canine group, emphasizing balanced nutrition and practical feeding management.

## Key Features

* **Tabbed Navigation:** Provides an intuitive interface to easily switch between three distinct meal plan options: "Steamed & Kibble," "Raw & Kibble," and "Raw Only."
* **Detailed Plan Breakdowns:** Each meal plan includes a comprehensive list of daily ingredients, precise quantities, recommended supplements, and calculated individual dog portions.
* **Visual Data Representation:** Utilizes dynamic doughnut charts to visually illustrate the proportional breakdown of ingredients within each meal plan, enhancing user comprehension.
* **Critical Health Disclaimers:** Prominently features important warnings and advice regarding bone content, raw feeding practices, and the essential need for professional veterinary consultation to ensure dietary safety and completeness.
* **Striking Dark Theme:** The design employs a pure black background for the overall page, complemented by slightly lighter, distinct inner content containers. Vibrant crimson reds and sharp, metallic silver/steel grey accents are used for text and interactive elements, creating a powerful and commanding visual experience.
* **Responsive Design:** The application's layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML:** Serves as the foundational structure for the web page content.
* **CSS (Tailwind CSS & Custom Styles):** Manages the visual presentation, responsive layout, and implements the unique dark theme.
* **JavaScript:** Powers the interactive elements, including tab switching and dynamic chart updates.
* **Chart.js:** A robust JavaScript library used for generating the informative doughnut charts.

This project offers a practical and aesthetically pleasing solution for managing complex canine dietary needs.
